⚠️ **Notice: No Longer Maintained** ⚠️

I no longer use OpenWrt as my operating system for router devices. This repository is **not actively maintained**. 🛑

A few devices are still used as clients, and the legacy "full fat" build scripts remain available in various branches for reference. This `master` branch now contains only a minimal build script, reflecting my current usage of OpenWrt. 🧩

Feel free to explore, fork, or use the scripts as you wish! 🚀
